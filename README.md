# Bluecasts

This project contains a fresh Laravel 7 install to demonstrate using [Blueprint](https://github.com/laravel-shift/blueprint) to rapidly generate the code for a Laracasts-like application.

You may view the generated code on the [`demo` branch](https://github.com/jasonmccreary/bluecasts/tree/demo).

You may watch a recording of this in action on [Laracasts](https://laracasts.com/series/guest-spotlight).
